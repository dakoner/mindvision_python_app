Always keep UI-creation details in the .ui file rather than in the .py file

Always test the program by running this command: 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/src/microtools/mindvision_qobject/release:~/src/microtools/mindvision_qobject/Lib uv run src/mindvision_python_app/main.py

Strategic replace Tool Usage: The replace tool requires an exact literal match for old_string and is highly sensitive to whitespace. Avoid replacing large, complex blocks of code. Prefer smaller, more targeted replacements. Always re-read the target file immediately before executing a replace command to ensure the old_string is based on the file's current content.
